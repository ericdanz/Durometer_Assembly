Durometer Assembly for PTC1

Thoughts:

Lead screw to the side of the weight now seems like a bad idea.

Going to make a lead screw that is driven from the top rather than the side. To do this we will need guide rails and 2 thrust bearings.

Added parts:

- [Set Screw Shaft Collar](http://www.mcmaster.com/#57485k68/=v53iqz)
- [Black-Oxide Class 12.9 Socket Head Cap Screw](http://www.mcmaster.com/#91290a137/=v51zug)
- [Metric 18-8 Stainless Steel Unthreaded Spacer](http://www.mcmaster.com/#92871a698/=v51r1j)
- [Hardened Precision Metric Steel Shaft, 200mm](http://www.mcmaster.com/#6112k101/=v8j6wh)
- [Two-Piece Clamp-on Shaft Collar](http://www.mcmaster.com/#6063k15/=v51282)
- [Steel Thrust Ball Bearing](http://www.mcmaster.com/#6655k55/=v58mok)

The thrust bearings have a low dynamic load capacity, but we can get better ones if we need.
